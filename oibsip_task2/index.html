                        <h3>Here's a timeline of Shaheed Bhagat Singh's life:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>1907</b> - Born in village Banga, Pakistan.</li>
                            <li><b>1923</b> - Joined the National College in Lahore.</li>
                            <li><b>1924</b> - Became a member of the Hindustan Republican Association.</li>
                            <li><b>1928</b> - British set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in
                                India. Lala Lajpat Rai, a prominent leader of HRA, Rai died of a heart attack.<br>Enraged
                                by this incident, Singh vowed to avenge Rai’s death and teamed up with other
                                revolutionaries, Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to make a plan
                                to kill Scott.</li>
                            <li><b>1929</b> - Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly
                                chamber from its public gallery. Their intention was not to kill anyone but to gain
                                publicity. After the explosion, the young men began shouting the slogan "Inquilab
                                Zindabad!" ("Long Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. Then they offered themselves
                                for arrest.</li>
                            <li><b>1931</b> - Singh’s growing popularity bothered the British authorities greatly, and the
                                government decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial, which was
                                henceforth called the Lahore Conspiracy Case.<br>Hanged in the Lahore jail. Bhagat Singh
                                was just 23 years old. The bodies were then secretly cremated outside Ganda Singh Wala
                                village.</li>
                        </ul>
